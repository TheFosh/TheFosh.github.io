            <span class="description">
                Given a text file, find the first and last numbers in the string. In part one, only the actual digits (i.e. 1, 2, 3, …) counts. For part two, any word that spells a digit (i.e. one, two, three, …) also counts. Find the first and last valid digit of a line of a string. These digits form a two-digit number. Do this for all lines in the string and add the numbers found together to get the answer to the problem.

                    This code was used for finding the last char possible from the given string line. It makes use of the fact that you can perform mathematical expressions and comparisons with chars. This lets me figure out if which char is an actual number and which isn’t.

                The input given for this problem represents games of pulling cubes out of a bag. Each line is a different game of pulling cubes and has a varying out of times pulled from it (with replacement). For part one, determine which games could be possible to have 12 red, 13 green, and 14 blue. This will lead to the answer. For part two, determine the smallest possible number of cubes in each game’s bag. This will lead to a new answer.

                The input given represents scratch cards where there are winning numbers and your numbers on either side of the cards. For part one, determine the number of pairs for winning numbers and your numbers on cards. This number is used for calculating the score which is the answer to this part. For part two, every time you find a winning card, that card makes copies of the cards after based on the number of winning pairs on it. These new copies of cards are also able to generate copies of cards after it as well. Count the number of original and copied cards that contain a winning pair. This is the answer for part two.
